Getting tired of typing a million commands to move a few folders?

Try chaining together locations to move faster. For example, cd ../../../Buffer_Beginner_Trail moves up three directories, then into Buffer_Beginner_Trail.

Each time you type ../ you move up one directory. 

Make sure to put the "/" in between each of the locations.
